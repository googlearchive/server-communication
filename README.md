## HTTP Client (Server Communication)

Welcome to the example application used in angular.io/dart's
[HTTP Client (Server Communication)](https://angular.io/docs/dart/latest/guide/server-communication.html) page.

You can run a [hosted copy](http://angular-examples.github.io/server-communication) of this sample. Or run your own copy:

1. Clone or [download][] this repo.
   [download]: //github.com/angular-examples/server-communication/archive/master.zip
2. Get the dependencies:

  `pub get`
3. Launch a development server:

  `pub serve`
4. Open a browser to `http://localhost:8080`.<br/>
  In Dartium, you'll see the app right away. In other modern browsers,
  you'll have to wait a bit while pub converts the app.
